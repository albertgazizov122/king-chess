Interesting task on "coursera" - King's move! It may seem simple, but I wanted to write down the solution. 1) Initially, formulated the problem on paper 2) Made trial tests for each move 3) I looked again how to use the nested "else-if" operator 4) Wrote the final code and tested it. It's incredible! it turned out to make a working code), although at first the tests did not pass, and I strengthened the solution by writing each option separately.
